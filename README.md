# Insta-schuimer - get pictures

With this quick python script, one can turn a Zeeschuimer-ndjson into a folder with all images (thumbnails if the item is a video).

## Prerequisites

I won't go into too much detail here, since this is just a quick script that might be outdated by tomorrow, but you'll at least need Python and some modules. See `requirements.txt`.

## How to run

Place a ndjson file in the source folder, name it properly and run `python ndjson_to_images.py`.
